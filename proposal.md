# Title : Color Theory Stimulation

## Repository
https://github.com/eliaroller/Color_Theory_Stimulation

## Description
1-2 sentence description of what it will do and how it relevant to media and digital arts.

This project focuses on turning on a digital lightbulb that can change color which also changes the color of a sphere next to it. This is very useful for artists as reference to identify correct lighting values and hues based on different light colors from the environment.

## Features
- Feature 1 : Uses an interactible lightbulb through keyboard command and buttons by importing turtle.
	- Short explaination of how it will be executed.
 - By importing turtle, I can create a pen movement to manipulate the lightbulb graphic.
   
- Feature 2 : Uses keyboard keyboard keys to change lightbulb colors.
	- Short explaination of how it will be executed.
 - uses pygame to take keyboard input to change rgb values of the lightbulb color.
   
- Feature 3 : The colors of sphere changes.
	- Short explaination of how it will be executed.
 - the rgb values of the sphere changes based on the color of the lightbulb through an update function.

## Challenges
- Short sentence of any skill or topic that needs to be learnt or researched.
- I would need to further research on pygame and turtle modules to best dynamically create the color change lightbulb and sphere.
  
- Short sentence of any skill or topic that needs to be learnt or researched.
- I would also need to learn more about rgb value manipulation.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Briefly describe what is the ideal outcome?

- The ideal outcome is to get the bulb color to change and it should affect the sphere RGB colors as well. It is also important to make sure the user can change the lightbulb color values through keyboard input especially the .keydown method.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Briefly describe the bare essential for a good working outcome?

- The bare essential is to make sure both the lightbbulb and sphere changecolor accordingly to the color theory ideas.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Goal 1 : Set up main function alongside defining class types for rgb values for the lightbulb and sphere.
  2. Goal 2 : Set up the graphics for both the lightbulb and sphere after importing the turtle module.

- Week 2
  1. Goal 1 : Create functionality to change lightbulb color via keyboard using E key.
  2. Goal 2 : Sphere color gets updated to reflect the changed lightbulb color using the update function.

- Week N (Final)
  1. Goal 1 : Polish any syntax or other types of errors.
  2. Goal 2 : Add comments to make the code more readable while also adding functionality for casting shadows on the sphere object.

## Description

This project focuses on a lightbulb source light and a ball which stimulates lighting scenarious with various colors. Through Pygame, I was able to draw both the shape of the lightbulb and the ball. I was then able to get the lightbulb to follow the position of the mouse as it can be dragged across the screen to stimulate a lighting scenario in real time. I also added a highlight by using the same method as drawing the ball but within the borders of the ball shape and set it to a white color RGB. I also added a system to change the colors of the lightbulb. The main feature and purpose for this program is to allow artists to get a reference for lighting options for 2D assets that can be dynamically affected by a lightsource and how they would look in an artwork or an engine.
